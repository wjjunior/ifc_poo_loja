# Symplicity Brasil - PHP Developer test

Hello, thanks for your interest in joining our team.

The purpose of this test is to verify your coding and architecture skills. For this you will get a simple problem where you can show your development techniques.

We encourage you to overdo the solution a bit to show what you are capable of.

Consider a scenario where you are building an application where other developers will need to work and maintain that application over time.

## Instructions

- Clone this repository.
- Create a new branch named `your-name / dev`
- Develop the applications.
- Create a pull request from the `your-name / dev` branch to the ` master` branch.

## Test Requirements:

- Display the category name in the product list.

- Add to category listing the number of linked products in each.

- Ensure that a category can only be deleted if it has no linked products.

- Ensure the operation of all CRUD operations.

Good luck!
